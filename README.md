o	Title Extraction: Obtains the first meaningful non-empty line from each document.
o	Search: Implements case-insensitive keyword search using regular expressions.
o	Classification: Based on keyword matching against a predefined taxonomy stored in a JSON structure.
o	Storage: Uploaded documents are saved locally in storage/documents/, while classification results are stored in storage/classifications.json.


3. Software Architecture and Design
3.1 Overview of the Architecture
The Cloud Document Analyzer is architected as a modular, cloud-deployed application built using Python and the Flask framework. The solution follows a three-tier architecture:
1.	Presentation Layer (Front-End): HTML templates rendered through Flaskâ€™s render_template system. Pages include Home, Upload, Search, Classify, Documents, Categories, and Statistics.
2.	Application Logic Layer (Back-End): Handles core processing including document uploading, text extraction, title sorting, keyword searching, classification, and statistics generation. Modular services handle each task independently.
3.	Storage Layer:
o	File Storage: All documents are saved locally in a cloud-accessible directory: storage/documents/.
o	Classification Metadata: Stored in a simple NoSQL-style JSON file: storage/classifications.json.
Deployment takes place on PythonAnywhere, a cloud platform providing a Linux-based Python environment with persistent storage and Flask web app hosting.

â€¢	No Background Tasks: Long-running background jobs must be managed synchronously.
â€¢	Limited File System Permissions: Reading/writing is only allowed within specific folders â€” storage/ was used accordingly.
â€¢	No Access to External Network by Default: Web scraping is not implemented to avoid issues with outbound HTTP requests in the free tier.
4. Used Cloud Services and its Interfaces
The Cloud Document Analyzer system is deployed and operated on PythonAnywhere, a Python-focused Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environment. It enables hosting Flask web applications in a Linux server environment accessible via a public URL. The program is made available to users through the live deployment interface:
ðŸ”— Live Demo â€“ Cloud Program on PythonAnywhere
Cloud Services Utilized:
â€¢	Web Application Hosting (Flask on WSGI Server):
PythonAnywhere allows deploying Flask applications with WSGI configuration. This service powers the interactive GUI and routes used for search, upload, sort, classify, and statistics.
â€¢	Persistent File Storage:
All uploaded documents are stored on the cloud server within a designated folder (storage/documents). PythonAnywhere provides a persistent file system, ensuring file retention even after restarts.
â€¢	File-based metadata storage following NoSQL principles:
Classification metadata is stored in a JSON file (storage/classifications.json), mimicking a NoSQL document database.
â€¢	Web Interface:
HTML templates are rendered and served via Flask routes. Users interact with the system using endpoints like:
o	/upload
o	/search
o	/classify
o	/documents
o	/categories
o	/statistics
The integration between the user interface and the backend cloud services is seamless and occurs over standard HTTP requests managed by Flaskâ€™s routing system.
